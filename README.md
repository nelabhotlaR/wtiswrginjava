# wtiswrginjava
A collection of simple errors that beginners are likely to hit when they start writing Java

Improve your Java by fixing errors
We present small code samples that have errors in them. Initially, there is only one error and it is relatively easy to spot. As we move up challenges, there are multiple errors and subtle bugs.

Why do this at all?
By working through these examples, we hope you get better at:

reading errors
debugging
reading and editing other people's code
Googling for specific issues
solving errors on your own
Motivation for creating this repository
We noticed that people learning new programming languages lack some foundational skills like the ability to read errors, the knowledge to self-correct their own mistakes, the skill to limit their attention to only the relevant lines of code, etc. This repository is a collection of simple errors that beginners are likely to hit when they start to write Java code. Our idea is to present exercises in which beginners can experience errors and try to solve them on their own.

How to use this repository
We suggest you do the following

Fork this repository

In your terminal prompt (git bash, command prompt, etc.), navigate to each challenge directory (e.g.: 01_challenge)

Run the one Java script in the challenge directory (complie the code using javac 01_challenge.java and then run java 01_challenge)

It should throw an error that reads similar to the .png in the challenge directory

Fix the error and rerun

If all goes good, you should see the output of running fizz buzz

Once you fix the issue, update the readme file in the challenge directory (01_readme.md) with:

a. what part of the error message gave you a clue

b. how you set about solving the issue (e.g.: I Googled XXXX that didn't help me narrow down my problem. After that, I tried Googling Java XXXX and finally ended up Googling for Java XXXX error. Then I found a page that looked promising because YYYY. Much thanks to reddit user /u/danielsgriffin for this tip!)

c. summarize what you learned.

Don't forget to commit your fixed code and updated readme

Pro tip: Once you are setup, try your best to timebox each exercise to no more than 10-minutes. We recommend this tip for even rank beginners who know nearly nothing about Java!

NOTE: To get the most out of these exercises, we think beginners should use an IDE (e.g.: Visual Studio Code), use git and use one git branch per challenge. These are peripheral habits to the main exercises but they will go a long way in making you more comfortable in working with code.
